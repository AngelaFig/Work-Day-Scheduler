# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

By modifying starter code that was provided and adding code to script.js, I created an application that allows a user to access a schedule,displaying the user's current date, through which they can save events according to each hour of a typical work day (9am-5pm). The user will notice that the time blocks are color-coded according to whether the time slot is in the past(gray), present (pink) or future(green). The users events are stored in local storage to assure that their information is saved. With this application, a user can keep track of their busy schedule effectively. 

The appplication runs in the browser wherein the HTML and CSS is dynamically updated through the use of jQuery. The application's ability to access dates and times comes by was of the usage of day.js.  The application also relies on styling provided by Bootstrap.
